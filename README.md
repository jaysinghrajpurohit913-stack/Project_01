                                ✅ STEP 1: Fix Postman (Most Important)

                                In Postman, make sure ALL of these are true:

                                1️⃣ Method is POST
                                2️⃣ Go to Body tab
                                3️⃣ Select raw
                                4️⃣ Select JSON (top-right dropdown)
                                5️⃣ Send data like:

                                username

                                password

                                If you skip any one of these → backend receives nothing.
